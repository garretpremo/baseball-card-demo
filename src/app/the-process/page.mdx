# The Process

## 1. Prompting AI

Used the following JSON prompt in [Google Gemini](gemini.google.com) to generate a wireframe.

```
{
    "task": "write a web application for displaying baseball player statistics",
    "lookAndFeel": "modern and sleek",
    "theme": "dark",
    "animations": "quick",
    "pages": [
        {
            "title": "Players",
            "content": "A list of players and some basic statistics",
            "features": [
                {
                    "name": "player card",
                    "type": "overlay",
                    "specification": "Display a 'baseball card' of the player in the center of the screen when clicking the player in the list. The card should contain an image of the player and a summary of stats",
                    "animations": "tilt the card towards the mouse when hovering"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "codeRequirements": {
        "framework": "react",
        "includeRouting": true,
        "language": "TypeScript",
        "styles": "scss",
        "includeTailwind": true
    }
}
```

Full single file code Output:
<details>
    ```
    put code here
    ```
</details>

## 2. Create new Next.js application.

Ran the following script:

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```
<details>
    ![Create Next App](create-next-app.png)
</details>

## 3. Import Gemini code output

- Copied over pieces of code into appropriate files.
    - mock data
        - src/data/mock-players.ts
    - data models / types
        - src/models/player.ts
        - src/models/player-stats.ts
    - components
        - src/app/players/page.tsx
        - src/app/players/player-card.tsx

## 4. Formatting and Layout

- Improved the layout and formatting more to my liking.
- Added a quick and simple nav bar
- Not perfect, but good enough for a demo

## 5. Added markdown support, for this page!

### 5.1 Installed mdx

Add mdx support, so markdown could be rendered directly as a next.js page.

Installed the following dependencies:

```
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```


Added appropriate configuration

---

### 5.2 Added a new page to render the mdx

- src/pages/the-process/page.mdx

---

### 5.3 Noticed that tailwind removed all default styling from the markdown

- Added `@tailwindcss/typography` package to selectively disable tailwind with a `prose` class
- Added a `layout.tsx` file to wrap the entire markdown page with `<div class="prose">`

### 5.4 More formatting tweaks

- Sticky header
- Improved layout for a scrolling page
- Added an `prose-invert` class to have dark mode in the markdown

### 5.5 Wrote this article

Now that the article is done, adding a margin bottom so you can scroll a bit below the bottom.
